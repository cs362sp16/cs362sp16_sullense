Bug report 2

Bug: my random game tester hits an infinite loop and the game never stops. 

Severity: 

Medium because if there is no way to stop the game, that could be slightly annoying when playing, but when actually playing, it is easy to stop it yourself. 

Priority:

Medium because just not being able to stop the game isnâ€™t a huge problem.

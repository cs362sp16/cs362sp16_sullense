For the first four unit tests for the functions in dominion.c, I tested the initializeGame, getCost, discardCard, and isGameOver. 
For the unit testing for card implementation I tested Smithy, Great Hall, Adventurer, and Treasure Map. 

The only bug I found was in Smithy, and that was that it gave the player one too few cards. 

When I ran code coverage, all of my tests covered at least 90 percent of each test.
